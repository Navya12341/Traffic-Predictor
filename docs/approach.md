# Technical Approach

## Problem Statement
Building a high-accuracy multi-class classification pipeline optimized for large datasets with parallel processing capabilities.

## Unique Aspects
1. **Advanced Preprocessing**
   - KNN imputation for missing values
   - Intelligent categorical encoding
   - Automated duplicate removal

2. **Parallel Feature Engineering**
   - Multi-core processing using joblib
   - Statistical feature generation
   - Polynomial feature creation
   - Outlier detection using IQR method

3. **Memory-Efficient Processing**
   - Checkpoint saving at each stage
   - Progress tracking with tqdm
   - Memory usage monitoring with psutil

4. **Ensemble Learning**
   - RandomForest base model
   - HistGradientBoosting for robustness
   - Soft voting classifier
